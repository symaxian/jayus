This repository holds the latest source for jayus, as well as the full compilation toolchain, and hosts some minified versions for remote linking.

The minified versions:

- http://symaxian.github.io/jayus/compiled/jayus-alpha.min.js
- http://symaxian.github.io/jayus/compiled/jayus-alpha-debug.min.js
- http://symaxian.github.io/jayus/compiled/jayus-latest.min.js
- http://symaxian.github.io/jayus/compiled/jayus-latest-debug.min.js

If you are trying out Jayus I recommend using the alpha version with debugging abilities. Jayus is still in active(and chaotic) development and the latest version of the code is almost guaranteed to be buggier. I am unsure how soon I will be able to set aside a "1.0" or even stable version, so anything and everything regarding Jayus is subject to change without warning, good luck.
